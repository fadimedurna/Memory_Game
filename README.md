# RULES:
You can only attempt to flip cards when its your turn. You're allowed to pick only 2 cards. After that,
you switch turns with the other player even if you matched a pair.
If all cards have been matched, the player who has more matched pairs wins. If both players scored the same,
it ends with draw.
By default the program uses images from the images directory.
The program connects to localhost by default.
